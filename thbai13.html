        <p class="dsugar">The Sugar Coating of Tablets</p> <br>
            <p>Sugarcoating of tablets is not as common in the pharmaceutical industry. Since it has been replaced by Polymer film coating. The sugar coating is generally water-soluble making it easier to dissolve quickly when it comes into contact with any liquid medium such as gastrointestinal fluids. One purpose of the sugar coating is to protect the drug inside the tablet and act as barrier to external contaminants. It may also hide or mask the unsavoury taste of the drug that some patients may find unpalatable. Sugarcoating insulates and masks the colour and texture of the tablet’s core.
